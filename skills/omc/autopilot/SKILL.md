# Autopilot

Full autonomous execution from idea to working code

## Trigger phrases
- "autopilot"

## Purpose

Extracted from OMC (oh-my-claudecode) skill system. This skill provides structured workflow automation.

## Workflow

See OMC documentation for detailed workflow steps.

## Original OMC Content

<Purpose>
Autopilot takes a brief product idea and autonomously handles the full lifecycle: requirements analysis, technical design, planning, parallel implementation, QA cycling, and multi-perspective validation. It produces working, verified code from a 2-3 line description.
</Purpose>

<Use_When>
- User wants end-to-end autonomous execution from an idea to working code
- User says "autopilot", "auto pilot", "autonomous", "build me", "create me", "make me", "full auto", "handle it all", or "I want a/an..."
- Task requires multiple phases: planning, coding, testing, and validation
- User wants hands-off execution and is willing to let the system run to completion
</Use_When>

<Do_Not_Use_When>
- User wants to explore options or brainstorm -- use `plan` skill instead
- User says "just explain", "draft only", or "what would you suggest" -- respond conversationally
- User wants a single focused code change -- use `ralph` or delegate to an executor agent
- User wants to review or critique an existing plan -- use `plan --review`
- Task is a quick fix or small bug -- use direct executor delegation
</Do_Not_Use_When>

<Why_This_Exists>
Most non-trivial software tasks require coordinated phases: understanding requirements, designing a solution, implementing in parallel, testing, and validating quality. Autopilot orchestrates all of these phases automatically so the user can describe what they want and receive working code without managing each step.
</Why_This_Exists>

<Execution_Policy>
- Each phase must complete before the next begins
- Parallel execution is used within phases where possible (Phase 2 and Phase 4)
- QA cycles repeat up to 5 times; if the same error persists 3 times, stop and report the fundamental issue
- Validation requires approval from all reviewers; rejected items get fixed and re-validated
- Cancel with `/oh-my-claudecode:cancel` at any time; progress is preserved for resume
</Execution_Policy>

<Steps>
1. **Phase 0 - Expansion**: Turn the user's ide
